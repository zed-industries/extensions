-   Creation of the first release, inspired by the iconic shell screen from the 1999 film "The Matrix".
-   Designed the theme to emulate the green-on-black aesthetics seen in the film's opening command "Call trans opt: received. 2-19-98 13:24:18 REC:Log>".
-   Developed the dark version of the theme, ensuring vibrant green text and accents for readability and immersion.
-   Ensured a cohesive and nostalgic experience, making your coding environment visually appealing and reminiscent of classic green phosphor CRT monitors.
